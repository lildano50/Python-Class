# Soccer Simulator

## Purpose
This was a project to test my Python skills I learned in my first programming course. It started as a basic idea that I ran with one late night. I since ignored it but wish to revisit as time permits
to add more functionality. It may never become anything beyond a basic RNG soccer simulator, but can work as a testing ground as I learn more. 

## Function
As it works now, you simply continue through the prompts and RNG determines the score. 

## Future Development
I'd like to incorporate more user choices to help dictate the outcome over just RNG. Selecting your team and opponent could come with pros and cons that help dictate the outcome in conjunction
with selecting shot placement (ie a striker is good shooting at particular places on goal, a goalie is good saving certain directions. With it shot change vs home/away advantage shift).
